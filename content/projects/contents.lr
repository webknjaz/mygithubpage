title: What I do
---
body:

I'm trying to make time for many projects I maintain or contribute otherwise. The list is quite long but here are a few experiments and projects I've been caring about lately:

* [intersphinx untangled] ([src][intersphinx-untangled-src]) — it's my
   attempt to visualize the linkables that Sphinx-based websites expose
* [Ansinight: ansible-base+ansible Dumb PyPI] ([src][ansinight-src]) — my
   take at building the nightlies of ansible-base and Ansible for use in CIs
* [ansible-pylibssh] — this is a thin Cython wrapper of libssh for use in
   Ansible as a paramiko substitute, I'm mostly helping out with the
   packaging, docs, CI, and testing automation
* [ansible-base] — this is the heart of the [Ansible] ecosystem, it's is my main
   activity during the workdays
